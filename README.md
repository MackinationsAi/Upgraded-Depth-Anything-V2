<h1>Upgraded Depth Anything V2 - UDAV2</h1>
</div>

This work presents Depth Anything V2. It significantly outperforms [V1](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything) in fine-grained details & robustness. Compared with SD-based models, it enjoys faster inference speed, fewer parameters, higher depth accuracy, & a robust upgraded Gradio WebUI as well as both image & video .bat scripts for more intuitive CLI usage (if that is your more preferred method of use).

## News

- **2024-06-14:** Paper, project page, code, models, demo, & benchmark are all released.
- **2024-06-20:** The repo has been upgraded & is also now running on .safetensors models instead of .pth models.
- **2024-06-23:** Updated installation process to be a simpler one_click_install.bat file. It automatically downloads the depth models into a 'checkpoints' folder, the triton wheel into the repo's main folder & installs all of the dependencies needed. *[Also updated this README.md file to provide more clarity!]*
- **2024-06-24:** [pravdomil](https://github.com/pravdomil) has provided a much need update to UDAV2 for 16bit image creation in order to make stunning 3D Bas-Reliefs! I am currently in the process of updating the gradio webui to include both 16bit single image & 16bit batch image creation which will be pushed in the coming days.
- **2024-06-25:** I'm currently working on a beta version of UDAV2 as an automatic1111 extension & will be released next week, so stay-tuned! 
- **2024-06-27:** A1111 extension released! [sd-webui-udav2](https://github.com/MackinationsAi/sd-webui-udav2)

## Windows Installation

All you need to do is copy & paste (or right-click), each of the following lines in-order into cmd & everything will be installed properly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MackinationsAi/Upgraded-Depth-Anything-V2.git
cd Upgraded-Depth-Anything-V2
one_click_install.bat
```
That's it! All you have to do now is pick one of the run_-------.bat files, double-click & you're off to depthing!

## MacOS & Linux Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MackinationsAi/Upgraded-Depth-Anything-V2.git
cd Upgraded-Depth-Anything-V2
source one_click_install.sh
```

## Usage

### Gradio WebUi

To use the upgraded gradio webui locally:

#### For Windows
```bash
run_gradio.bat
```
You can also try the [online gradio demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Depth-Anything/Depth-Anything-V2), though it is FAR less capable than this Upgraded Depth Anything V2 repo.

#### For MacOS & Linux

```bash
python run_gradio.py
```

### Running run_image-depth_16bit.py CLI script to make 16bit images for creating 3D Bas-Reliefs!

***It works for both single image depth processing & batch image depth processing.***

```bash
run_image-depth_16bit.bat
```
### 3D Bas-Relief from 16bit Image Depth Maps Examples

*The images used to make the following depth maps were created using Dreamshaper Turbo.**

### Running run_image-depth_8bit.py CLI script

***It works for both single image depth processing & batch image depth processing.***

```bash
run_image-depth_8bit.bat
```
or

```bash
python run_image-depth.py --encoder <vits | vitb | vitl> --img-path <path> --outdir <outdir> [--input-size <size>] [--pred-only] [--grayscale]
```

Options:
- `--img-path`: You can either 1.) point it to an image directory storing all interested images, 2.) point it to a single image, or 3.) point it to a text file storing all image paths.
- `--input-size` (optional): By default, we use input size `518` for model inference. **You can increase the size for even more fine-grained results.**
- `--pred-only` (optional): Only save the predicted depth map, without raw image.
- `--grayscale` (optional): Save the grayscale depth map, without applying color palette.

For example:
```bash
python run_image-depth.py --encoder vitl --img-path assets/examples --outdir depth_vis
```

### Running run_video-depth.py CLI script

***It works for both single video depth processing & batch video depth processing.***

```bash
run_video-depth.bat
```
or

```bash
python run_video-depth.py --encoder vitl --video-path assets/examples_video --outdir video_depth_vis
```

## Pre-trained Models *[.safetensors]*

We provide **three models** of varying scales for robust relative depth estimation (the fourth model is still a WIP):

***All three models are automatically downloaded to a 'checkpoints' folder in your repo when you run the one_click_install.bat. (I only provided the download link here incase you want to download them elsewhere for use outside this repo)***


| Models | Params | Checkpoints |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| Depth-Anything-V2-Small model | 48.4M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/MackinationsAi/Depth-Anything-V2_Safetensors/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vits.safetensors?download=true) |
| Depth-Anything-V2-Base model | 190.4M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/MackinationsAi/Depth-Anything-V2_Safetensors/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vitb.safetensors?download=true) |
| Depth-Anything-V2-Large model | 654.9M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/MackinationsAi/Depth-Anything-V2_Safetensors/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vitl.safetensors?download=true) |
| Depth-Anything-V2-Giant model | 1.3B | *Coming soon* | [Download Doesn't Work - Model is still a WIP](https://huggingface.co/MackinationsAi/Depth-Anything-V2_Safetensors/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vitg.safetensors?download=true) |


*Please note that the larger (vitl) model has better temporal consistency on videos.*

## Triton Dependency Wheel

***This dependency .whl is automatically downloaded to the main/tree repo-folder when you run the one_click_install.bat. (I only provided the download link here incase you want to download it elsewhere for use outside this repo.)***


| Dependency | Params | Wheel |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| Triton==2.1.0 | 306.7M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/MonsterMMORPG/SECourses/blob/main/triton-2.1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl?download=true) |


*(Once it has been installed & the gradio webui is running properly, you can delete it or use it elsewhere in a similar fashion.)*

### *Notes:*
- Compared to V1, we have made a minor modification to the DINOv2-DPT architecture (originating from this [issue](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/issues/81)). In V1, we *unintentionally* used features from the last four layers of DINOv2 for decoding. In V2, we use [intermediate features](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2/blob/2cbc36a8ce2cec41d38ee51153f112e87c8e42d8/depth_anything_v2/dpt.py#L164-L169) instead. Although this modification did not improve details or accuracy, we decided to follow this common practice. 
- **I will be updating the training scripts to support .safetensors output pre-trained models in the coming weeks so stay-tuned for more UDAV2 depthing updates!**
